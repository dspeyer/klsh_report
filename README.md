# klsh_report

- Structure: add intro
- LSH: add rho

- emphasize bilinearity, generates H from X

- vectorspace => vector space

- m and t in 4.1 Normal distribution in order to approximate the covariance of the Phi(X), which can be turned into a normal gaussian

Possible Outline:
-----------------

1. Introduction - briefly LSH algorithm + kernel methods / how to kernelize is goal
2. Kernel theory + why kernelize
3. LSH ball carving method
4. Need Gaussian => getting a normal distribution in kernel
5. Total KLSH algorithm
6. Extending KLSH


Daniel:
- unusual similarity measures
- ball carving between KLSH intro & normal distribution
- further directions/data-dependent

Geelon:
- expand the practical part of kernel
- normal distribution + covariance estimation
